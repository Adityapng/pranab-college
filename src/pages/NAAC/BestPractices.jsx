                The core objective of this institution is preparing and
                nurturing the young girl students to become a complete women or
                whole person. To achieve this vision the mission of the
                institution is to impart holistic education for the empowerment
                of women with great emphasis on inculcating value to nurture the
                growth of well balanced personality. <br />
                <br /> The institution caters to girl student from all over
                state from varying socio-economic background. A large number of
                students come from the remote part of Nagaland due to lack of
                quality educational opportunity in their area. As such most of
                them are away from home. Majority of these girl students either
                stay in a private hostel or in a rented house. Thus many
                students are free from constant parental monitoring. Moreover
                the situation further aggravated by the fact that most of them
                comes from poor economic background. Free from parental control,
                weak financial situation, facing the challenges of living in
                city makes them vulnerable to value crisis ridden situation. To
                curb this disturbing trend the college initiated value based
                programme as a part of the co-curricular activities. The purpose
                of this programme is nurturing the young mind to develop a deep
                sense of social responsibilities and meet the future challenges
                successfully.

                Two classes in a month are allotted for value education. Topic
                related with ethics and social values are open for discussion.
                It also focuses on the issues and problems generally faced by
                the girl students and means and ways to tackle the problem.
                Attendance is mandatory for the students.

                As a part of inculcating value among the students the
                institution organised a yearly Charity Day.The students and
                staff donated both in cash and kinds. The proceeds from the cash
                donation and sales of donated goods are donated to orphanages in
                and around Dimapur city as a part of our Community Outreach
                Programmes. Funds were also raised by the students by opening
                food stalls as well. The initiatives are taken mostly by the
                students. The main objective of this programme is to inculcate
                the values and spirit of giving and sharing with our less
                privileged fellow beings.

                As a part of Community Outreach Programme the students pay a

                orphanage like – cleaning, washing, bathing, spend time with the
                inmates etc. Students also carried out cleanliness drive in a

              <p className="pt-4 ">
                The evidence of success is shown by increasing participation of
                students in the programmes and activities conducted under value
                education programme. The initiatives for most of the programme
                are taken by the students, it also help in shaping leadership
                qualities in them. Many academically weak and passive students
                taking up a leading role is also observed. It give them a
                platform for discover their leadership qualities thereby
                building up their confidence and self-esteem. The spirit of
                giving and sharing also developed among the students which are
                also reflected in the increasing amount of fund raised during
                Charity Day over the year. The outcome of this programmes are
                also reflected in the absence of suicide, depression or mental
                illness, scandals, immoral activities and anti-social behaviours
                among the students.

                Due to subjective nature of the programme the faculty in-charge
                of the programmes especially in counselling area sometimes moves
                beyond empathy and get emotionally attached with the client’s
                personal issues. If timely intervention is not taken, they
                suffer from burned out syndrome which is too taxing on the
                faculty members. Resource requires is sincerity, cooperation and
                enthusiasm on the path of teachers, management and students
                towards making the programme are success.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  Many institutions being faced with competition are compelled
                  to give priority to academically bright students during
                  college admissions. In the process, the academically weak
                  students are left out and most of them end up in non-reputed
                  colleges or give up further studies. In this process, many
                  promising students are denied the opportunities to fulfill
                  their desired goals and be a pillar of the society. The
                  institution believes that academically weak students do not
                  remain weak throughout. There is a possibility that there are
                  weak areas which needed attention, which if tended, can make
                  the students fare much better. As such, weak students do not
                  remain weak throughout nor academically strong students do not
                  remain strong throughout. Various factors in the academic
                  history can improve or denigrate the academic performance of
                  the students. Educational institution plays a vital role in
                  mentoring students to improve the weak and on the other hand,
                  nurture and further improve the academically strong students.
                  From this perspective, the colleges adopted a policy of
                  admitting any students irrespective of their past educational
                  standard offering them another opportunity to excel
                  themselves.

                <p className="font-semibold ">The Practice:</p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  The institution vision is to provide the weak and the under
                  privileged, particularly women to have access to higher
                  education in order to equip them with life skills to face the
                  challenges of the modern world. With this aim, during
                  admission, there is no cut-off mark for admission except
                  Honours papers which is mandatory to follow the minimum
                  criteria prescribed by the University. As such, many students
                  with poor academic record get the opportunity to study in the
                  college to pursue higher studies. In the post admission, one
                  month after the session started, every department assesses the
                  quality standards and potential of the students. Assessment is
                  done through academic performances like Class Test,
                  Participation and response during Teaching-Learning process.
                  Once the students who need extra attention and efforts are
                  identified, intensive tutoring and remedial coaching classes
                  are conducted for them. Non-serious students with
                  potentialities are given motivational counseling for academic
                  improvements. Each department constantly monitors the
                  performance of the students. Even guardian/parents are made to
                  be involved in order to create a conducive study atmosphere at
                  home by making them sign an undertaking that they will make
                  efforts to help their wards by cooperating with the
                  institute’s efforts.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  The practice has seen the college churn out thousands of
                  graduates out of academically weak students who hardly
                  qualified or met the criteria for pursuing higher education.
                  The college has equipped them with at least a degree which has
                  opened to them an avenue of employment. The evidence of
                  success of this practice is also revealed by the number of
                  average and below average students securing 1st and 2nd
                  divisions and some University topper in various disciplines.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  This practice is however challenging in its application due to
                  the wide academic disparities among the students. Going by the
                  fact, that the college admits a large number of weak students,
                  majority of the students in the class rooms are composed of
                  weak students. In order to keep the pace with the weak
                  students, the teachers had to precede the course and teach at
                  a slower pace. However, for the bright students, the pace of
                  the course and teaching are found to be too slow and
                  monotonous. As such, the teachers have to strike a fine
                  balance while teaching in the class rooms composed of wide
                  academic disparities. Constant monitoring of the students
                  sometimes proves to be too taxing on the teachers. As a
                  result, some teachers suffer from work overload and burnout
                  syndromes. The resources required is dedication, patience and
                  determination on the part of teachers which are provided
                  constantly, driven by the philosophy behind the institution’s
                  goals.
