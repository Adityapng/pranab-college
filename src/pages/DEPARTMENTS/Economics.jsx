              focuses on the study of economic theories, principles, and
              applications. It aims to understand how resources are produced,
              distributed and consumed in society and to analyse various

              offers minor course to the students. The department provides
              students with a strong foundation in economic thought, preparing
              them to address real â€“ world economic challenges.
